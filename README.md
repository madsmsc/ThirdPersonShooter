Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9vPZiz8XYk, to fix better character and animation.

Research exactly which files should be committed, and which can be ignored with .gitignore.
Maybe find some samples of .gitignore files.
I don't really want the bytecode/binaries if they're not needed.

Fix jumping.

Fix the issue with small jumps when walking down slopes.

Fix strafing with A/D.

Fix enemy and player health bar.

Maybe grab some stuff from my other project to solve some of the above points.
